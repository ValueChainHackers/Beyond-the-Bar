## Strategic Fit

**How does this model align with sustainability goals?**

This Business Model Canvas demonstrates how the ESG Data Standard Template creates value by addressing critical gaps in cocoa supply chain transparency. By providing an open, standardized approach to ESG data collection, the initiative:

- Enables regulatory compliance (CSRD, EUDR)
- Reduces greenwashing and builds trust
- Unlocks finance for sustainable producers
- Facilitates research and education
- Creates a foundation for continuous improvement in cocoa sustainability

The model leverages the power of collaboration, open-source principles, and academic rigor to transform cocoa sector sustainability practices at scale.
