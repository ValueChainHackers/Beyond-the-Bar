Here is a 7-slide pitch outline with context, graphical narrative suggestions, and integrated data from this conversation, focused on the "ESG Data Standard Template" concept for the cocoa sector: 

***

### Slide 1: Introduction — The ESG Data Challenge in Cocoa  
**Context:** Supply chains are fragmented; sustainability data is scattered, inconsistent, and hard to verify. Regulations now require transparency but data chaos blocks compliance.  
**Graphical idea:** World map with fragmented supply chain dots and data silos icons.  
**Narrative:** The cocoa sector has long suffered from a lack of a unified sustainability data standard. Multiple players—from farmers to exporters—keep isolated data, making traceability and ESG reporting unreliable. This fragmentation threatens compliance with the EU Deforestation Regulation and CSRD, risking market access and reputation.[4][5]

### Slide 2: Problem Scope — Why Data Fragmentation Matters  
**Context:** Data fragmentation hides risks, blocks finance for farmers, and slows sustainability efforts.  
**Graphical idea:** Infographic showing effects: Poor traceability → Risk of greenwashing → Lost finance for farmers → Slower progress.  
**Narrative:** Without a shared ESG data standard, companies struggle to verify sustainable sourcing. Buyers cannot trace beans; farmers stay invisible to finance. The entire chain loses trust and agility, hindering real climate and social impact.[3][4]

### Slide 3: Regulatory Pressure — The Urgency of Harmonized ESG Data  
**Context:** New regulations mandate transparent, auditable, and comparable ESG data.  
**Graphical idea:** Timeline highlighting CSRD and EUDR enforcement dates with compliance obligations.  
**Narrative:** The EU CSRD and Deforestation Regulation require companies to provide standardized sustainability data or face penalties. Compliance demands consistent ESG metrics across all supply chain actors. Missing shared standards increases regulatory risks and costs.[1][5]

### Slide 4: Existing Efforts — Gaps and Opportunities  
**Context:** Current efforts like WCF’s GHG Accounting Standard prove the need but don’t cover all ESG data; certification systems remain fragmented.  
**Graphical idea:** Venn diagram showing overlap of existing frameworks (EUDR, CSRD, GRI) and gaps.  
**Narrative:** Organizations like the World Cocoa Foundation have pioneered GHG reporting standards, yet social, governance, and many environmental indicators lack unifying data templates. Certification systems operate independently, causing duplication and data silos.[10][1]

***

### Slide 5: Solution Concept — A Shared ESG Data Standard Template  
**Context:** A simple, open, student-built CSV/JSON schema defining minimum key ESG fields.  
**Graphical idea:** Flow diagram from data input (farmers to brands) → standardized template → open documentation → adoption via GitHub.  
**Narrative:** We propose creating a shared ESG data template describing essential sustainability metrics across the cocoa chain. This will enhance data quality, transparency, and compliance. By publishing openly on GitHub, we foster adoption and continuous improvement.[1][4]

***

### Slide 6: Impact — Benefits of a Shared Standard  
**Context:** Transparency, trust, faster finance, regulatory readiness, teaching/research asset.  
**Graphical idea:** Icons representing trust, finance, efficiency, education.  
**Narrative:** A shared template enables companies to meet reporting obligations, reduces greenwashing risk, and unlocks finance incentives for sustainable producers. It also serves as a foundational tool for research and capacity-building in cocoa sustainability.[5][4][1]

### Slide 7: Call to Action — Join the Movement  
**Context:** Invitation for collaboration from stakeholders and students to co-create and adopt the ESG template.  
**Graphical idea:** Collaborative network graphic with logos of partners, students, VCH, and cocoa stakeholders.  
**Narrative:** The cocoa sector stands at a crucial juncture—standardized ESG data is a must-have to ensure sustainable cocoa production and fair markets. We invite you to join this student-led initiative to build, document, and promote an open ESG data standard to transform cocoa sustainability.

This pitch integrates key data and sector realities to compellingly build the narrative and demonstrate the urgency and value of the shared ESG data standard concept.
