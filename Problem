## Problem 2 - Broken transparency and disconnected data in the cocoa chain

### Description
Almost 60% of the cocoa that comes from West Africa is still untraced (Cocoa Barometer 2025).  
Data about where beans come from, who grew them, and under what conditions is missing or locked in private systems.  
Many certification labels only track the first buyer, not the full route.  
Because of that, companies keep selling “sustainable” chocolate while they actually don’t know if it is child-labour free or deforestation free.  

### Root cause
- Data is spread over hundreds of exporters, middlemen, cooperatives and certification bodies.  
- There is no shared digital infrastructure for traceability.  
- Many traders see transparency as a risk, not a benefit.  
- Governments and industry still rely on paper audits instead of real-time data exchange.  

### Impact
- Around 2 million cocoa farmers stay invisible in the global market and get no reward for good practices.  
- Companies can’t meet new EU laws like the EUDR and CSRD because they can’t prove origin.  
- NGOs and consumers lose trust, and the same sustainability claims get repeated every year without proof.  
- The chain keeps working on short-term fixes instead of long-term partnership with farmers.  

### Sustainability by design leverage
If transparency becomes part of how money and data flow, sustainability will follow naturally.  
A shared open-source traceability layer could connect farmers, cooperatives and buyers in one verified data chain.  
When verified data unlocks faster payments or better finance terms, every actor has a reason to be honest.  

### VCH project fit
**Beyond the Bar – Trace**  
Value Chain Hackers can build an open traceability framework using Supabase, PostgREST and graph-based databases like Apache AGE.  
Students and partners test it with real cocoa routes to make transparency a working business function instead of an extra cost.
