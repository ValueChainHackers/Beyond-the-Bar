## Purpose of This Form
This standardized traceability form serves as the **primary data collection instrument** for the cocoa value chain. By completing this form at each stage of the supply chain, actors create a comprehensive, auditable record that meets EUDR requirements while establishing a de facto ESG reporting standard for the cocoa sector.

**Key principle:** *Transparency through standardization - one form, one format, one truth.*
